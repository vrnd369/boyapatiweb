              <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
              <p>
                Our ancestors consistently demonstrated that additive-free and
                nutrient-rich food is quintessential for leading a healthy
                lifestyle. This is one of the founding principles of our parent
                firm, Boyapati Dairy, which is a family-owned business that
                started in 1989 with just five cows and buffaloes.
              </p>
              <p>
                From humble beginnings, our small dairy nestled in a tiny
                community thrived into an incredible farm with 500-cattle that
                produces milk, ghee, and other dairy products across multiple
                facilities across Vijayawada, India. Over the last three
                decades, Boyapati Dairy has continued raising grass-fed cattle
                producing premium quality dairy products that have become an
                essential part of our customers' healthy lifestyle.

              <h2>OUR STORY. OUR PASSION.</h2>
              <p>
                Do you have fond memories of eating additive-free savories made
                by your grandparents?
              </p>
              <p>
                If your answer is yes, you have come to the right place. Backed
                by our motto, "Purity At Its Best," we established Boyapati
                Dairy and Foods in 2019 with a mission to bring back the sweets
                from our childhood and reimagine them without any preservatives
                or artificial colors.

                <h3>Pure Ghee - Our Secret Ingredient</h3>
                <p>
                  We only use Pure Ghee made in Bilona Method for preparing all
                  our savories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike most refined oils, Ghee is full of healthy fats, which
                  help our body absorb some essential vitamins and minerals. We
                  are one of the very few savory makers in India who make all
                  their products with pure ghee. We are sure you will fall in
                  love with the rich flavor of our ghee in every single bite.
